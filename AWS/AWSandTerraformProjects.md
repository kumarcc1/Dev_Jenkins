Here are some Terraform and AWS projects that you can work on to gain hands-on experience:

1. Automated Infrastructure Deployment: Use Terraform to automate the deployment of a simple infrastructure in AWS, including a VPC, subnets, security groups, and EC2 instances.

2. Load Balancer and Auto Scaling Group: Use Terraform to deploy a load balancer and auto scaling group in AWS to automatically scale a web application based on demand.

3. Serverless Web Application: Use Terraform and AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3 to build a serverless web application that can handle incoming HTTP requests and store data in the cloud.

4. Multi-tier Architecture: Use Terraform to deploy a multi-tier architecture in AWS, including a web tier, application tier, and database tier, using EC2 instances, RDS, and ELB.

5. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Use Terraform and AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a sample application.

6. Disaster Recovery: Use Terraform and AWS to implement disaster recovery for a sample application, including the creation of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and the configuration of an EC2 Auto Scaling group.


These projects can help you gain hands-on experience with Terraform and AWS, and also provide a solid foundation for further learning and exploration in the cloud computing and DevOps fields.
